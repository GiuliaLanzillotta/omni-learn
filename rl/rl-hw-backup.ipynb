However, several of the environments in the OpenAI-gym require additional simulators which don't aren't easy to get on Windows. In any case, it is strongly recommended that you use Linux, although you should be ok with Mac. (HINT: if you're on Windows check out the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), although it'll make visualizing your policies a little tricky).\n",

For full credit you must fill in the code below so you achieve an average total reward per episode on the cartpole task (CartPole-v1) of at least 499 (for an episode length of 500) for both REINFORCE and A3C. Then you must apply your code to any one other environment in OpenAI-gym, and plot and compare the learning curves (average total reward per episode vs number of episodes trained on) between REINFORCE and A3C (where at least one of the algorithms shows significant improvement from initialization).\n",
